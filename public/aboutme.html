                        This is me at age 11.
                        <br><br>
                        I loved Pokemon and Sailor Moon (well, I still love those things). 
                        <br><br>
                        Also I was teaching myself HTML to make my first websites.

                        Who would have thought I was laying the foundation for my future career?

            <div class="smallAbout">
                I have worked as an API Support Specialist in Raleigh, North Carolina, since 2018. I aid developers in their integrations with my company's APIs. I diagnose bugs written in various programming languages daily. The customer development experience is my top priority.
                <br><br>
                My background is in writing, mathematics, and library science. I have a bachelors in creative writing and math from Warren Wilson College in Asheville, NC. I have also taken masters level courses in information studies at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, which is where I was first exposed to JavaScript. From all of my education, I have learned valuable talents like research skills, logical problem solving, effective exposition, navigating information on the Internet and in databases, communicating with customers, and a tenacious work ethic.
